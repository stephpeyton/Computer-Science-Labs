# Computer-Science-Labs
Python Course Lab Assignment

In this lab, I built a Car Inventory Management System in Python using object-oriented programming and a binary search tree (BST). The project included three main classes:

Car – stored information such as make, model, year, and price, with comparison methods to support sorting and equality checks.

CarInventoryNode – represented nodes in the BST, holding a list of cars with the same make and model, as well as links to parent and child nodes.

CarInventory – the main inventory system, with functions to add and remove cars, check if a car exists, find the best or worst car, calculate the total inventory price, and traverse the tree in different orders (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

I also created unit tests to confirm correctness, covering scenarios like duplicate entries, removals, and traversal outputs.

This lab strengthened my skills in class design, recursion, data structures, and test-driven development while modeling a real-world inventory system.
